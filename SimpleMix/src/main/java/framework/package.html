The package <code>framework</code> introduces all parts of the mix and the overall framework, which are not exchanged.

<p>
First, it establishes the interfaces <code>Controller</code> and <code>Implementation</code> which are used by the implementations
of all the components of the mix. Each component (offering methods) 
has its own (architecture) interface (see package <code>architectureInterfaces</code>).
Furthermore, the interface <code>ComponentReferences</code> is provided, which enables all components to access
all of the controllers, the logger and the settings class of a specific mix and the mix itself.

<p>
Second, the mix itself is provided. The class <code>Mix</code> itself sets up one mix to be used in a mix cascade.
<p>
General information: A mix is some kind of proxy that attempts to hide the 
correspondence between its incoming and outgoing messages, as proposed by David 
Chaum in 1981. 

<p>
Third, the classes <code>Logger</code>, <code>Settings</code>, <code>DuplicatePrintStream</code>,
<code>Util</code> and <code>MixProperties</code> are provided for internal tasks of the mix.

<p>
Fourth, the helper class <code>LocalClassLoader</code> is provided. This class is responsible for loading the specified
<code>Implementation</code>s.

<p>
The <code>Framework</code> itself sets up the environment, starts mixes and provides the necessary components. This class could also be
used to test the mixing.
