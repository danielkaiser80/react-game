The package <code>gui</code> helps the software engineer who wants to establish his own implementations of the components to set up
a working configuration file. Therefore, a sample config file could be loaded, the components could be selected and tested and a
working configuration file could be saved.

<p>
The GUI is started witht the class <code>MixGUI</code>. The classes <code>MixCompoent</code> and <code>MixPanel</code> are helper
classes which contain parts of the user interface.
